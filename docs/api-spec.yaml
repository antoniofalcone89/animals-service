    Backend API for Animal Quiz Academy — an educational quiz app about animals
    with gamified progression.

    ## Authentication

    Authentication is handled **client-side** by Firebase Authentication.
    The Flutter app signs in via Firebase (email/password, Google, Apple, etc.)
    and receives a Firebase ID token.  That token is sent as a `Bearer` token
    in the `Authorization` header on every API request.

    The backend verifies the token using the Firebase Admin SDK.  No login or
    sign-up endpoints exist on the server — the only auth endpoint is
    `POST /auth/register`, which creates the user's **app profile** (username,
    coins, progress) after they have already authenticated with Firebase.

    ### Flow

    1. Client authenticates with Firebase → receives ID token.
    2. Client calls `POST /auth/register` with `Bearer {idToken}` and a chosen
       username to create their app profile.
    3. Client calls `GET /auth/me` (or any other endpoint) with the same token
       for subsequent requests.

    ### Development / Mock mode

    When `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` is not set, the API runs in **mock auth mode**:
    any non-empty Bearer token is accepted, and its value is used as the user
    ID.  This is useful for local development and testing.
